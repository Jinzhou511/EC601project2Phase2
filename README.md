This project can achieve:
① Get a specified number of tweets from a specified user. In this case, I choose JoeBiden to be the analyzed user.
② Filter unimportant information such as symbols and numbers in the obtained tweets.
③ Calculate the subjectivity and polarity of each tweet, and give the sentiment.
